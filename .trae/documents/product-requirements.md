## 1. Product Overview
API Key Manager is a secure desktop application for macOS that allows users to manage API keys locally and safely. The application provides a comprehensive solution for storing, testing, and organizing API credentials for various services including trading platforms (Binance, Bybit, Oanda), AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter), and development tools (GitHub).

The product solves the problem of scattered API key management by providing a centralized, secure, and user-friendly interface for developers and traders who work with multiple API services.
